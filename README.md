# InYourFridgeAPI

#### Current web API made with .NET 7, used as a refresher for main Web Application practices

Though multiple Microsoft tutorials were referenced, this project was put together in a much more puzzle-like fashion than going line by line through a tutorial.  Each portion was coded from prior knowledge, with only finer points and syntax being referenced.

Potential future plans for the project include adding more entities to the database, such as users, and creating a frontend to consume the API.

#### Links

Due to using the free version of the database, it may be unresponsive for the first few calls, returning a 500 error code.  It should wake up and begin working within a minute, but reach out if the issue persists.
